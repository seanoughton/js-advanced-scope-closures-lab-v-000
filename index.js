//Returns a function that then calculates whether a given trip is within range. For example, produceDrivingRange(10) returns a function that will return false if the trip is over 10 blocks distance and true if the distance is within range. So produceDrivingRange returns a function that we can then use to calculate if a trip is too large for a driver. We recommend referencing the test/indexTest.js for more details.

function produceDrivingRange() {
  return function () {

  };
};
